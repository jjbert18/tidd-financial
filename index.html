        <h2 class="section-title">Retirement programs for business owners</h2>
        <p>Here at Stryde, we work with many businesses to facilitate individualized, personalized and proprietary retirement programs. One of the more powerful approaches we use is a front loaded retirement program, called the Stryde Retirement Program (SRP), created by Stryde.</p>
        <p>While there are many nuances to the methodologies behind the working parts of this structure, the SRP is simply a tool through which a business owner may have the ability to drastically advance their wealth accumulation relative to their retirement planning efforts in a highly tax advantaged manner. This methodology, when applicable, gives business owners the opportunity to take a tax deduction relative to their participation, grow their wealth tax deferred and take distributions out of this retirement planning medium tax free.</p>
        <p>Additionally, it jump starts their retirement by advancing massive amounts of capital in their program for them, with the goal of realizing superior gains as a result of having more money working for them. This lends itself to having the ability to generate a much larger nest egg than through other approaches that may then be distributed on a tax free basis.</p>
        <ul class="column-cards">
            <li> <h4>Wealth Transfer:</h4>Transfer massive amounts of wealth to your heirs, charity, school or foundation utilizing the most powerful and cost effective manner while guaranteeing the results </li>
            <li> <h4>Estate Plan:</h4>Engage in estate planning utilizing the benefits of your business to accomplish the most cost effective ILIT in existence </li>
            <li> <h4>Qualified Plan Rescue:</h4>By redirecting participating funds, the opportunity exists to generate a structure that results in tax free distributions that may be applied against taxes due on distributions out of a qualified plan </li>
            <li> <h4>Business Exit Planning:</h4>With the ability of the front loading to be assumed, it may provide massive benefit to the business seller and buyer at sale </li>
            <li> <h4>Key-man & Buy/Sell:</h4>With the insurance contained within the structure, it can be used as a wealth accumulation medium and address insurance needs simultaneously</li>
